Papataka Book Club is a Virtual Book Club where we discuss about books and participate in fun reading activities.

## Group Rules
- Always keep to the purpose of the group, which is books and only books. Don’t share any messages about other topics. strictly no forwards.
- If you want to share any info not related to books but its useful for the group, please contact the admin first.
- Always try to post your message in one single chunk of text, don’t post every word or sentence in a new message.
- If a message asks for a positive response like an RSVP, don’t reply in the negative. Only say if you are able to attend. Don’t double RSVP if a second call to action is sent out for the same event.
- If someone asks a question and you don’t know the answer don’t respond with “I don’t know”. Just wait for someone who knows the answer to reply.
